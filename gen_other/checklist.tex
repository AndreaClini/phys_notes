\subsection*{What is missing?}
%--------------------------------------------------------

\begin{itemize}
    \item rewriting the ope for sm, showing that it works. now based on peskin, can we find something new to say also on the math side?
    \item choosing the portal(s?). how many ldsp can we have as bullets? are the bullets stable or unstable on detector scales? can they emerge in lhc?
    \item rewriting the ope for ds
    \item choosing the experiment(s?). do we want to have a reliable prediction for initial fluxes? 
   \item More on the formal side it would be very interesting to better understand the OPE expansion of DIS in explicit realizations of gapped theories with a conformal window such as Randall-Sundrum, and relate our result to the unparticle idea of Georgi. This investigation can shed further light on what can be said about the DIS from the purely IR perspective.
\end{itemize}
