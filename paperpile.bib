                   the Dark Matter (DM) is allowed to decay in an invisible
                   relativistic component, and compute the resulting constraints
                   on both the decay width (or inverse lifetime) $\Gamma$ and
                   $f$ from purely gravitational arguments. We report a full
                   derivation of the Boltzmann hierarchy, correcting a mistake
                   in previous literature, and compute the impact of the decay
                   --as a function of the lifetime-- on the CMB and matter power
                   spectra. From CMB only, we obtain that no more than 3.8 \% of
                   the DM could have decayed in the time between recombination
                   and today (all bounds quoted at 95 \% CL). We also comment on
                   the important application of this bound to the case where
                   primordial black holes constitute DM, a scenario notoriously
                   difficult to constrain. For lifetimes longer than the age of
                   the Universe, the bounds can be cast as $f\Gamma <
                   6.3\times10^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$. For the first time, we also
                   checked that degeneracies with massive neutrinos are broken
                   when information from the large scale structure is used. Even
                   secondary effects like CMB lensing suffice to this purpose.
                   Decaying DM models have been invoked to solve a possible
                   tension between low redshift astronomical measurements of
                   $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and the ones inferred by
                   Planck. We reassess this claim finding that with the most
                   recent BAO, HST and $\sigma_8$ data extracted from the CFHT
                   survey, the tension is only slightly reduced despite the two
                   additional free parameters, loosening the bound to $f\Gamma <
                   15.9\times10^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$. The bound however improves to
                   $f\Gamma < 5.9\times10^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$ if only data
                   consistent with the CMB are included. This highlights the
                   importance of establishing whether the tension is due to real
                   physical effects or unaccounted systematics, for settling the
                   reach of achievable constraints on decaying DM.",

               attention due to their potential ability to resolve the
               well-known clustering (or S8) tension between weak lensing (WL)
               and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. In this
               paper, we investigate a well-established model where the original
               dark matter particle decays into a massless particle and a
               massive daughter particle. The latter obtains a velocity kick
               during the decay process that results in the suppression of the
               matter power spectrum at scales that are observable with WL shear
               observations. We perform the first fully non-linear WL analysis
               of this two-body decaying dark matter ($\Lambda$DDM) scenario,
               including intrinsic alignment and baryonic feedback processes. We
               used the cosmic shear band power spectra from KiDS-1000 data and
               combined it with temperature and polarisation data from Planck in
               order to constrain the $\Lambda$DDM model. We report new limits
               on the decay rate and mass splitting parameters that are
               significantly stronger than previous results, especially in the
               case of low-mass splittings. Regarding the S8 tension, we found a
               reduction from about 3 to 2$\sigma$, depending on which
               statistical measure is applied. We therefore conclude that the
               two-body $\Lambda$DDM model is able to reduce the S8 tension

                   scenario, when the decay products are effectively massless.
                   We assume, as a base case, that all of dark matter is
                   unstable and it can decay on cosmological time scales. We
                   then extend the analysis to include the scenario where only a
                   fraction of dark matter is unstable, while the remaining part
                   is composed of the standard, stable, dark matter. We consider
                   observations of cosmological probes at linear scales, i.e.,
                   Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background temperature,

                   over conventional BAO and redshift space distortions

                   prior from KiDS-1000. We show that, in order to fit EFTofBOSS
                   data while lowering $S_8$ to match KiDS-1000, the best-fit
                   model has a longer lifetime $\tau = 120$ Gyr, with a larger
                   kick velocity $v_{\rm kick}/c \simeq \varepsilon \simeq

                   The decay parameter space is parameterized by $v_k$, the

                   the heavier particle prior to decay, and the decay time

                   have formed before there has been significant decay, I focus
                   on the effects of decay in already-formed halos. I show that

                   We have updated them with the latest data as well as extended
                   the analysis with the inclusion of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest,
                   large scale structure and weak lensing observations.
                   Astrophysical constraints are not considered in the present
                   paper. The bounds on the lifetime of decaying dark matter are
                   dominated by either the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe
                   effect for the scenario with weak reionization, or CMB
                   polarization observations when there is significant
                   reionization. For the respective scenarios, the lifetimes for
                   decaying dark matter are $\Gamma^{-1} \gtrsim 100$ Gyr and $
                   (f \Gamma) ^{-1} \gtrsim 5.3 \times 10^8$ Gyr (at 95.4\%

                   is the fraction of the decay energy deposited in baryonic

                   dark matter candidates through investigation of dark matter
                   decays into Standard Model particles via effective operators.
                   For decaying dark matter of $\sim 100$ GeV mass, we found

                   dimension-4 operators responsible for dark matter decay has
                   to generically be $ \lesssim 10^{-22}$. We have also explored

                   of ungauged lepton number, one of the mechanisms proposed to
                   give rise to neutrino masses. The majoron can acquire a mass
                   through quantum gravity effects, and can possibly account for
                   the observed dark matter component of the Universe. We
                   present constraints on the majoron lifetime, mass and

                   to \Gamma\textasciicircum{-1}> 123 Gyr at 68\% C.L. (52 Gyr
                   at 95.4\% C.L.) when cold dark matter consists only of such
                   decaying particles. We also consider a more general case in
                   which cold dark matter consists of both stable and decaying
                   particles, and show that the constraint generalizes down to
                   \Omega\_{DDM}h\textasciicircum2 5 Gyr at 95.4\% C.L.. These
                   bounds are robust and widely applicable, because they are
                   derived only from gravitational effects and therefore do not
                   rely on the details of decay channels or decay products.",

                   theories and classify them according to the imprints they
                   leave on the smooth background expansion history of the
                   Universe and on the evolution of linear perturbations. The
                   effective field theory of dark energy is based on a
                   Lagrangian description of cosmological perturbations which
                   depends on a number of functions of time, some of which are
                   non-minimal couplings representing genuine deviations from
                   General Relativity. Such a formalism is thus particularly
                   convenient to fit and interpret the wealth of new data that
                   will be provided by future galaxy surveys. Despite its recent
                   appearance, this formalism has already allowed a systematic
                   investigation of what lies beyond the General Relativity
                   landscape and provided a conspicuous amount of theoretical
                   predictions and observational results. In this review, we

                   scales, i.e. strongly coupled in the UV and weakly coupled in
                   the IR. To make precise analytical predictions on large

                   terms of an IR effective fluid characterized by several
                   parameters, such as speed of sound and viscosity. These
                   parameters, determined by the UV physics described by the

                   powerful discriminator between models, when it is measured by
                   Planck with accuracy $\Delta n\sim 0.01$. The usual formula
                   for $n$ is derived, as well as its less familiar extension to
                   the case of a multi-component inflaton; in both cases the key

                   order of magnitude, it is important to account for any

                   amplitude of $f_{\rm NL} = \mathcal{O}\left( 0.1 \right)$. We
                   also compute the dipole induced by wide-angle effects, whose

                   Matter. We study the behavior of the background cosmology and
                   linear perturbations in such a Universe. At the background
                   level, the new force modifies the evolution of the Dark

                   become indispensable tools in cosmology, where time-dependent
                   backgrounds are the norm. In this work, we demonstrate that
                   in spacetimes undergoing significant expansion-such as
                   accelerated FLRW and de Sitter backgrounds-the contributions
                   of operators with mass dimension $\Delta$ to physical
                   observables grow factorially with $\Delta$ at fixed
                   couplings. This behavior stands in stark contrast to
                   expectations from flat spacetime. As a result, the
                   cosmological EFT expansion is generally asymptotic rather
                   than convergent, even at tree level. To illustrate this

                   where the heavy field is effectively non-dynamical, the
                   resummed EFT reproduces the exact result of the full theory.

                   hypercharge, that automatically avoid direct detection
                   constraints from tree-level Z-exchange. We compute for the
                   first time all the calculable thermal masses for scalar and
                   fermionic WIMPs, including Sommerfeld enhancement and bound
                   states formation at leading order in gauge boson exchange and
                   emission. WIMP masses of few hundred TeV are shown to be
                   compatible both with s-wave unitarity of the annihilation
                   cross-section, and perturbativity. We also provide theory
                   uncertainties on the masses for all multiplets, which are
                   shown to be significant for large SU(2) multiplets. We then
                   outline a strategy to probe these scenarios at future
                   experiments. Electroweak 3-plets and 5-plets have masses up
                   to about 16 TeV and can efficiently be probed at a high
                   energy muon collider. We study various experimental
                   signatures, such as single and double gauge boson emission
                   with missing energy, and disappearing tracks, and determine
                   the collider energy and luminosity required to probe the
                   thermal Dark Matter masses. Larger multiplets are out of
                   reach of any realistic future collider, but can be tested in
                   future gamma ray telescopes and possibly in large-exposure

                   streaming wavenumber ($k_{\rm fs}$) is typically longer than
                   the non-linear scale ($k_{\rm NL}$) are described by a
                   Boltzmann equation coupled to the effective fluid-like
                   equations that describe dark matter. We solve the equations
                   expanding in the neutrino density fraction $(f_\nu)$ and in
                   $k/ k_{\rm NL}$, and add suitable counterterms to renormalize
                   the theory. This allows us to describe the contribution of
                   short distances to long-distance observables. Equivalently,
                   we construct an effective Boltzmann equation where we add
                   additional terms whose coefficients renormalize the
                   contribution from short-distance physics. We argue that
                   neutrinos with $k_{\rm fs}\gtrsim k_{\rm NL}$ require an
                   additional counterterm similar to the speed of sound ($c_s$)

                   ones can either be computed in terms of $c_s$, or can be
                   accounted for by shifting $c_s$ by an amount proportional to

                   important to have a precise understanding of the cosmological
                   observables; for this reason, the Effective Field Theory of
                   Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) was developed. So far, most
                   results in the EFTofLSS have used the so-called Einstein-de
                   Sitter approximation, an approximation of the time dependence
                   which is known to be accurate to better than one percent.
                   However, in order to reach even higher accuracy, the full
                   time dependence must be used. The computation with exact time
                   dependence is sensitive to both infrared (IR) and ultraviolet
                   (UV) effects in the loop integrands, and while these effects
                   must cancel because of diffeomorphism invariance, they make
                   numerical computation much less efficient. We provide a
                   formulation of the one-loop, equal-time exact-time-dependence

                   the same perturbative order. In the real universe other
                   parameters can be important, and there are possibly enhanced
                   effects due to nonlinear interactions of long and short

                   redshift-space galaxy bispectrum monopole at one-loop order
                   in perturbation theory. We incorporate all effects necessary
                   for comparison to data: fourth-order galaxy bias, infrared
                   resummation (accounting for the non-linear evolution of
                   baryon acoustic oscillations), ultraviolet counterterms,
                   non-linear redshift-space distortions, stochastic
                   contributions, projection, and binning effects. The model is
                   implemented using FFTLog, and validated with the PT Challenge
                   suite of $N$-body simulations, whose large volume allows for
                   high-precision tests. Focusing on the mass fluctuation
                   amplitude, $\sigma_8$, and galaxy bias parameters, we find
                   that including one-loop corrections allow us to significantly
                   extend the range of scales over which the bispectrum can be
                   modeled, and greatly tightens constraints on bias parameters.
                   However, this does not lead to noticeable improvements in the
                   $\sigma_8$ errorbar due to the necessary marginalization over
                   a large number of nuisance parameters with conservative
                   priors. Analyzing a BOSS-volume likelihood, we find that the
                   addition of the one-loop bispectrum may lead to improvements
                   on primordial non-Gaussianity constraints by $\lesssim 30\%$
                   and on $\sigma_8$ by $\approx 10\%$, though we caution that
                   this requires pushing the analysis to short scales where the
                   galaxy bias parameters may not be correctly recovered; this
                   may lead to biases in the recovered parameter values. We
                   conclude that restrictive priors from simulations or
                   higher-order statistics such as the bispectrum multipoles
                   will be needed in order to realize the full information

                   relevant across a range of phenomena from the dynamics of
                   inflation to the formation of structure. In many cases, these
                   fluctuations are coarse grained and follow a Gaussian
                   distribution as a consequence of the Central Limit Theorem.
                   Yet, some classes of observables are dominated by rare
                   fluctuations and are sensitive to the details of the
                   underlying microphysics. In this paper, we argue that the
                   Large Deviation Principle can be used to diagnose when one
                   must to appeal to the fundamental description. Concretely, we
                   investigate the regime of validity for the Fokker-Planck
                   equation that governs Stochastic Inflation. For typical
                   fluctuations, this framework leads to the central limit-type
                   behavior expected of a random walk. However, fluctuations in
                   the regime of the Large Deviation Principle are determined by
                   instanton-like saddle points accompanied by a new energy
                   scale. When this energy scale is above the UV cutoff of the
                   EFT, the tail is only calculable in the microscopic
                   description. We explicitly demonstrate this phenomenon in the
                   context of determining the phase transition to eternal
                   inflation, the distribution of scalar field fluctuations in

                   package, PyFPT, that solves the first-passage time problem of
                   generic one-dimensional Langevin processes. In the
                   stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism, these are related to the
                   curvature perturbation at the end of inflation. We apply this
                   method to quadratic inflation, where the existence of
                   semi-analytical results allows us to benchmark our approach.
                   We find excellent agreement within the estimated statistical
                   error, both in the drift- and diffusion-dominated regimes.
